6.    Creating an Account on the Site

If you create an account on the Site, you may only create and hold one account that you are solely responsible for managing. Your account is non-transferable and may not be sold, combined or otherwise shared with any other person. If you violate any of these limitations we may terminate your account and, without limitation, you may forfeit any pending, current or future promotional account credits and any unredeemed Coupons in your account. If we terminate your account, you may not re-enroll or join under a new account unless we formally invite you. If you commit fraud or falsify information in connection with your use of the Site or in connection with your GenerUs account, your account will be terminated immediately and we reserve the right to hold you liable for any and all damages that we suffer, to pursue legal action through appropriate law enforcement authorities and to notify your Internet service provider of any fraudulent activity we associate with you or your use of the Site.

7.    Terms of Sale

Coupons purchased on the Site by you as a GenerUs account holder are special promotional offers that you purchase from participating Merchants through our service. The Coupons are redeemable for certain products, services or experiences offered by, or facilitated through, the Merchant identified on the Coupon. The Merchant is solely responsible for redeeming the Coupon. By placing an order for a Coupon, you make an offer to purchase the Voucher you have selected pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the terms on the Coupon itself and any additional deal-specific terms advertising the Coupon at the time of purchase (the “Fine Print”). In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Fine Print, the Fine Print will govern.

There are two separate parts to each Coupon: (a) the purchase value and (b) the promotional value (except if the purchase value is equal to the full offer value of the Coupon, in which case there is no promotional value). Together the purchase value and the promotional value add up to the full offer value of the Coupon The purchase value is the amount you pay to buy a Coupon. The purchase value does not expire until it is used or refunded. The promotional value is the “added” value of the Coupon – the amount in excess of the purchase value. The promotional value will expire by the date stated on the face of the Coupon unless applicable law prohibits the promotional value from expiring. For example, if you pay $80 for a Coupon that entitles you to $100 of goods or services from a Merchant, the full offer value is $100, the purchase value is $80 (and that amount does not expire until it is used or is refunded), and the promotional value is $20 (and that amount expires on the date stated on the Coupon, unless expiration of the promotional value is prohibited by law).

In the event you redeem your Coupon for less than the full offer value stated on the Coupon, your purchase will be allocated first against the purchase value until it has a balance of zero dollars ($0.00), and then against the promotional value that is remaining.

Purchase, use or acceptance of a Coupon constitutes acceptance of these Terms of Use and of any Fine Print stated on the Coupons. The following terms apply to all Coupons, unless stated otherwise in a Coupon’’s Fine Print or otherwise required by applicable law:

•	No cash value for any Coupon.
•	Coupons cannot be used to make a payment on a credit account.
•	No cash back will be issued for partial redemption of the paid portion of a Coupon, except as required by law.
•	No cash back or credit will be issued for partial redemption of the promotional portion of a Coupon.
•	Entire value of Coupon must be used in one visit.
•	Taxes and gratuities are not included in the value of the Coupon and, if applicable, may be charged to you separately by the Merchant when you redeem the Coupon.
•	If applicable, shipping and handling fees are not included in the value of the Coupon and may be charged to you separately by the Merchant when you redeem the Coupon.
•	Use of a Coupon for alcoholic beverages is at the sole discretion of the Merchant unless otherwise noted on the Coupon and use of a Coupon for alcoholic beverages and certain other certain products and services is subject to applicable local, provincial, territorial and federal laws.
•	Coupons cannot be combined with any other coupons or promotions unless otherwise noted in the Coupon or required by law.
•	Your Coupons may only be used at the Merchant and Merchant location(s) named on the face of the Coupon, and if a Coupon is specific to a product or service, it is not redeemable for any other product or service.
•	Coupons are not reloadable.
•	Duplicate use, reproduction, resale, modification or trade of Coupons is prohibited, except as required by law.
•	Neither GenerUs nor the Merchant is responsible for lost or stolen Coupons or Coupon reference numbers.
•	Coupon purchases are considered final sales upon payment. Since our featured deals are promotional, time-sensitive and involve a donation to a NPO, returns are not offered.  If you have any questions regarding our return policy, contact us at support@coupons4giving.ca. 

The Merchant is the issuer of the Coupon and is solely responsible for honoring and fulfilling the Coupon (including without limitation for supplying all products and services specified in the Coupon), for all customer service in connection with the Coupon and the products and services supplied to you, and for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs (“Liabilities”) it may cause you to suffer, directly or indirectly, in full or in part, whether related to the use or redemption of a Coupon, or the use of any products or services provided in connection with a Coupon, or otherwise. YOU WAIVE AND FULLY, FOREVER, AND ABSOLUTELY RELEASE GENERUS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PARTNERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS AND REPRESENTATIVES, AND PARTICIPATING NPO’S, FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES ARISING FROM OR RELATED IN ANY WAY TO ANY ACT OR OMISSION OF A MERCHANT IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OR REDEMPTION OF A VOUCHER OR YOUR USE OF THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IT PROVIDES IN CONNECTION WITH A VOUCHER. 

8.    Price and Payment

The price of any Coupon will be as quoted on the Site or in authorized emails from time to time, except in cases of obvious error.  If there is an obvious pricing error in relation to a Coupon which could have reasonably been recognized by you as a mis-pricing, then we have the right to cancel any such issued Coupon and issue you a refund in respect of the same. For example, if the amount or percentage of a discount displayed on the Site, in an authorized email or on a Coupon does not correlate with the price listed, this is an obvious pricing error.

Payment for Coupons may be made by such credit card or other payment means that we make available from time to time through the Site.

9.    Modification of this Agreement

We reserve the right at all times to discontinue or modify any part of this Agreement as we deem necessary or desirable. If we make changes that materially affect your use of the Site or our services (as determined by us in our sole discretion) we will notify you by sending you an e-mail to the e-mail address that is registered with your account and/or by posting notice of the change on the Site. Any changes to these Terms of Use will be effective upon the earlier of our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or our posting of notice of the changes on our Site; provided that, these changes will not apply to Coupons purchased prior to the effective date of such changes. These changes will be effective immediately for new users of the Site and for all Coupons purchased after the effective date of the change. We suggest that you revisit our Terms of Use from time to time to ensure that you stay informed of any such notifications of changes to the Site. Your use of the Site after we update these Terms of Use will constitute acceptance of the modified Terms of Use.

We also reserve the right to change or discontinue any aspect or feature of our services or the Site including, but not limited to, requirements for access or use.

13.   Arbitration and Waiver of Class Actions

(a)  We place a high priority on customer satisfaction, and accordingly we will endeavour to resolve any disagreements that you have with GenerUs to our mutual satisfaction. If those efforts fail, by using this Site you agree that any claim, dispute or controversy you may have against GenerUs arising out of, relating to or connected in any way with this Agreement, the Site or the purchase or sale of any Voucher(s), shall be resolved exclusively by final binding arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Act (Alberta), R.S.A. 2000, c. A-43, as amended from time to time (the "Arbitration Act"). Arbitration shall be by a single arbitrator mutually acceptable to the parties. If the parties are unable to agree upon a single arbitrator, either GenerUs or you may apply to the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta for advice and directions on making such an appointment.  The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding, with no right of appeal, and may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction over the subject matter or either you or GenerUs. You agree further that: (a) the arbitration shall be held in the City of Edmonton, in the Province of Alberta; (b) the arbitrator shall apply the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable in the Province of Alberta consistent with the Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (c) unless you and GenerUs otherwise agree in writing, there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide only your and/or GenerUs' individual claims, and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated; (d) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, GenerUs will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (e) with the exception of subpart (c) above, if any part of this Section 13(a) is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Arbitration Act, then the balance of this Section 13(a) shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (c) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Section 13(a) shall be null and void, and neither you nor GenerUs shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.   The arbitrator shall determine to what extent each of the parties shall bear the costs and expenses incurred in connection with any such arbitration proceeding (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) on the basis of the arbitrator’s assessment of the relative merits of the parties' positions.
    
(b)  IN THE EVENT THAT SECTION 13(a) ABOVE IS FOUND TO BE INVALID, UNENFORCEABLE OR ILLEGAL, OR NULL AND VOID IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS TERMS, THEN YOU WAIVE, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO COMMENCE OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS PROCEEDING IN COURT AGAINST GENERUS RELATED TO ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST GENERUS ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR CONNECTED IN ANY WAY WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE SITE, THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF ANY VOUCHER(S) OR THE USE OR SUPPLY OF ANY PRODUCT(S) OR SERVICE(S) IN CONNECTION THEREWITH.

22.   Additional Disclosures

No waiver by either you or GenerUs of any breach or default or failure to exercise any right allowed under this Agreement is a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default or a waiver or forfeiture of any similar or future rights under our Agreement. The section headings used herein are for convenience of reference only and shall be of no legal force or effect. If any provision of our Agreement is held illegal, invalid or unenforceable by an arbiter or court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any other provision contained in this Agreement, and the remaining portions of our Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
    
The provisions of these Terms of Use apply equally to and are for the benefit of GenerUs, its affiliates, featured Merchants, featured NPOs, and its third-party content providers and licensors, and each shall have the right to assert and enforce such provisions directly or on its own behalf.
