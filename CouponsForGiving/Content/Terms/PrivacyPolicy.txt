We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies provided by these other parties prior to providing them with information or taking advantage of an offer or promotion.

If you wish to opt out of receiving offers directly from merchants, non-profit organizations or business partners, you can follow the opt-out instructions in the emails that they send you.
We will retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with Services and to maintain a record of your transactions for financial reporting purposes. If you wish to close your account, request that we no longer use your information to provide you with Services, or have other questions or requests, please follow the applicable instructions on the Site or contact us.
